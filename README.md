# Austin Tech Meetups
### A comprehensive list of Austin Tech Meetups with Codes of Conduct

After cataloging over 50 popular Austin Tech Meetups, I have found only about ~27% have a Code of Conduct. Codes of Conduct are important to create more diverse and inclusive communities. 

Please see how you help and contribute in the [What can I do?](#what-can-i-do) and [Contributions](#contributions) sections.

## What can I do?

If you are an organizer or part of a meetup that is not listed here and don't have a Code of Conduct, **please** bring it up with the organizers of the meetup. If you are wanting to be an ally of underrepresented groups in tech, this is a good first step. 

It is also important to remember to clearly explain how to report potential Code of Conduct violations and what the reporting experience is like. 

I'm also open to helping you establish a Code of Conduct within your meetup. 

## Resources

Ashe Dryden has created a comprehensive page of [Code of Conduct resources](https://www.ashedryden.com/blog/codes-of-conduct-101-faq). If you are looking for why your organization or meetup needs a Code of Conduct or have other questions related to Code of Conducts, I highly recommend it.

Audrey Eschright has a great talk on [Enforcing Your Code of Conduct: Effective Incident Response](https://youtu.be/nizfHxg8y3o), which can help you think about incident response and reporting guidelines within your Code of Conduct. 

TODO: Add more resources

## Contributions

If you would like submit a pull request adding a meetup that has a Code of Conduct, I will happily accept. 

I am also looking for PRs that has links directly to the Code of Conducts for each meetup and more Code of Conduct resources, especially around Reporting Guidelines.
